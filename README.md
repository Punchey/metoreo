# Metoreo
A meta-Oreo comprised of oreos

The Metoreo is a meta-Oreo comprised of a single vanilla Oreo which serves as the "filling", flanked by two halves of two chcolate (original) Oreos which serve as the "cookies" which sandwich the central vanilla Oreo.

## Dependencies:

2x original (chocolate) Oreos
1x vanilla Oreo

## Build instructions:

1. Disassemble the two chcolate Oreos using the twist method to ensure clean separation.
2. Discard the cookies which separate from the cream section.
3. Attach each chocolate half with cream to the outer cookies of the vanilla cookie, pressing firmly to ensure adhesion. Be careful to orient each cookie piece so that it's inner (undecorated) side faces inward toward the center of the metoreo.

You should wind up with two extra chocolate cookies which may be discarded or eaten, since the finished build makes use of 3 creams but only 4 cookies (2x vanilla, 2x chocolate are utilized).

# Known Issues

There is an intrinsic inefficiency in the design which involves the wastage of two Oreo halves (cookies). However, at this time, with modern Oreo design being what it is, this appears to be a fundamental limitation. Perhaps if you were content to have single stuffing between each layer, a single-stuffed vanilla cookie could be used for the center, and the outer layers use a perfectly split original chocolate Oreo Double Stuf, such that exactly half of the cream can be used on the top, and the other half on the bottom. However, more advanced cream-cleaving techniques would need to be developed to accomplish this.
