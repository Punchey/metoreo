Dependencies:

2x original (chocolate) Oreos
1x vanilla Oreo

Build instructions:

Disassemble the two chcolate Oreos using the twist method to ensure clean separation. Discard the cookies which separate from the cream section.

Attach each chocolate half with cream to the outer cookies of the vanilla cookie, pressing firmly to ensure adhesion.

Be careful to orient each cookie piece so that it's inner (undecorated) side faces inward toward the center of the metoreo.

You should wind up with two extra chocolate cookies which may be discarded or eaten, since the finished build makes use of 3 creams but only 4 cookies (2x vanilla, 2x chocolate are utilized).
